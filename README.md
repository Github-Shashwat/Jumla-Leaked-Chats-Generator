## 📖 About The Project

**Jumla** is the first tool in a planned suite of AI-powered satirical applications.

In the age of misinformation and spin, this tool takes a lighthearted approach to political commentary. It scrapes real-time news from major Indian news outlets, filters for "satire-worthy" controversies using AI, and generates a fake "leaked" WhatsApp chat.

The chat features a recurring cast of fictionalized political archetypes (The Messiah, The Chanakya, The Firebrand, etc.) brainstorming how to spin the narrative, shift blame, or announce a ridiculous new "Masterstroke."

### Key Features
* **📰 Real-Time News Integration:** Fetches live RSS feeds from Google News, The Hindu, NDTV, and Indian Express.
* **🧠 AI Editorial Filter:** Uses an LLM to analyze headlines and discard boring news (sports, weather), keeping only political/controversial topics.
* **🎭 Dynamic Personas:** Generates dialogue based on specific character archetypes (e.g., "Samit Shah" implies a ruthless strategist; "Mahendra Godi" speaks in slogans).
* **🎛️ User Controls:** You decide the narrative parameters:
    * **Blame Game:** Who is at fault? (Opposition, Foreign Hands, Nehru, etc.)
    * **Nationalism Level:** From "Subtle" to "Over 9000."
    * **Promise Tone:** Realistic promises vs. Wild Freebies.
* **📱 Visual Interface:** Renders the output in a CSS-styled WhatsApp conversation format.

## 🎭 The Cast (Personas)

The AI generates dialogue for the following fictional caricatures:

* **Samit Shah:** The ruthless strategist. Obsessed with election math and winning at all costs.
* **Jogi Raditya:** The firebrand. Believes the solution to everything is a bulldozer or a name change.
* **S. Rajshankar:** The intellectual snob. Blames "Western Hypocrisy" and "International Plots" for everything.
* **Nirmal Siyaraman:** The defensive economist. Expert at "Whataboutism" and disconnected from reality (e.g., "I don't eat onions").
* **Mahendra Godi:** The messianic leader. Speaks only in third-person slogans and vague platitudes.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Ethics

> **This project is strictly for educational and entertainment purposes (Political Satire).**

* The characters, though inspired by public figures, are fictional caricatures.
* The "Chats" are generated by Artificial Intelligence and are **fake**.
* This tool should not be used to spread misinformation or present these dialogues as factual events.
* The creators do not endorse hate speech; the goal is to parody the *rhetoric* used in modern political discourse.

This is **Part 1** of the "Satire Suite." Future tools planned include:

* **The Godi Media Headline Generator:** AI that rewrites bad news into positive "Masterstrokes."
* **Twitter Bot Army Simulator:** Simulating how a trend is manufactured.
* **The "Whataboutery" Engine:** An API that instantly finds a counter-argument from 70 years ago.
