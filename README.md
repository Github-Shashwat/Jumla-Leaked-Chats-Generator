# Jumla-Leaked-Chats-Generator
🎯 Jumla: The Satirical News Engine (Leaked Chats Generator)
A Python-based AI tool that turns real news headlines into satirical, "leaked" WhatsApp conversations between fictional political caricatures.

📖 About The Project
Jumla is the first tool in a planned suite of AI-powered satirical applications.

In the age of misinformation and spin, this tool takes a lighthearted approach to political commentary. It scrapes real-time news from major Indian news outlets, filters for "satire-worthy" controversies using AI, and generates a fake "leaked" WhatsApp chat.

The chat features a recurring cast of fictionalized political archetypes (The Messiah, The Chanakya, The Firebrand, etc.) brainstorming how to spin the narrative, shift blame, or announce a ridiculous new "Masterstroke."

Key Features
📰 Real-Time News Integration: Fetches live RSS feeds from Google News, The Hindu, NDTV, and Indian Express.

🧠 AI Editorial Filter: Uses an LLM to analyze headlines and discard boring news (sports, weather), keeping only political/controversial topics.

🎭 Dynamic Personas: Generates dialogue based on specific character archetypes (e.g., "Samit Shah" implies a ruthless strategist; "Mahendra Godi" speaks in slogans).

🎛️ User Controls: You decide the narrative parameters:

Blame Game: Who is at fault? (Opposition, Foreign Hands, Nehru, etc.)

Nationalism Level: From "Subtle" to "Over 9000."

Promise Tone: Realistic promises vs. Wild Freebies.

📱 Visual Interface: Renders the output in a CSS-styled WhatsApp conversation format.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (for the interactive UI).

LLM Orchestration: LangChain.

Models Supported:

Groq: Llama-3.1-8b (Fast & Free tier friendly).

OpenAI: GPT-3.5 Turbo.

Data Fetching: feedparser (RSS), BeautifulSoup4 (HTML cleaning).

Deployment/Tunneling: pyngrok (for local testing).

🚀 Getting Started

🎭 The Cast (Personas)
The AI generates dialogue for the following fictional caricatures:

Samit Shah: The ruthless strategist. Obsessed with election math and winning at all costs.

Jogi Raditya: The firebrand. Believes the solution to everything is a bulldozer or a name change.

S. Rajshankar: The intellectual snob. Blames "Western Hypocrisy" and "International Plots" for everything.

Nirmal Siyaraman: The defensive economist. Expert at "Whataboutism" and disconnected from reality (e.g., "I don't eat onions").

Mahendra Godi: The messianic leader. Speaks only in third-person slogans and vague platitudes.

⚠️ Disclaimer & Ethics
This project is strictly for educational and entertainment purposes (Political Satire).

The characters, though inspired by public figures, are fictional caricatures.

The "Chats" are generated by Artificial Intelligence and are fake.

This tool should not be used to spread misinformation or present these dialogues as factual events.

The creators do not endorse hate speech; the goal is to parody the rhetoric used in modern political discourse.

🗺️ Roadmap
This is Part 1 of the "Satire Suite." Future tools planned include:

The Godi Media Headline Generator: AI that rewrites bad news into positive "Masterstrokes."

Twitter Bot Army Simulator: Simulating how a trend is manufactured.

The "Whataboutery" Engine: An API that instantly finds a counter-argument from 70 years ago.
